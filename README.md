# arm_test

## Getting Started

- How long did you spend on the coding test?
 
>> I spent roughly about 14.5 hrs for the test

- What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

>> I would have been able to add the api for group chat, but due to time constaints, I could only add the conversation screens and a bit of simulation.

- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

>> Oh yes, 

- What improvement would you suggest to the Firebase team if you had the chance?

# arm_test

## Getting Started

- How long did you spend on the coding test?
 
>> I spent roughly about 12.5 hrs for the test

- What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

>> I would have been able to add the api for group chat, but due to time constaints, I could only add the conversation screens and a bit of simulation.

- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

>> Oh yes, I have had to track down a performance issue. So there was an issue with how a third party iframe [WebView] was been rendered on different devices at the time, it was not properly rendering well on android devices. This was tracked down due to the indepth analysis of user reports and bugs feedback from user. Other issues can be tracked using [Sentry] and similar providers.

- What improvement would you suggest to the Firebase team if you had the chance?

>> Errors being returned from firebase api e.g [signin], can be presented more friendly to end users.
